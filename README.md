# Streamline
### The API I was planning on using for this ([Guidebox](https://api.guidebox.com/)) discontinued their free access to the API while I was working on this, so thjis project is (curently) abandoned.
A basic android app which combines movies/tv shows from multiple streaming services using the guidebox API. I'm currently working on this to familiarize myself with the basics of android app development.
